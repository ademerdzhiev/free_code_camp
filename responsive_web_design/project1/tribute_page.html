      <h3 id="headline"> Here's a short autobiography of Geo Milev </h3>
      <div id="autobiography">
        <p> Geo Milev (born Georgi Milev Kasabov; 15 January [O.S. 27 January]
          1895, Radne mahle – 15 May 1925, Sofia), was
          a Bulgarian poet, journalist, and translator. Geo Milev is perhaps
          best known for his epic poem Septemvri, written in the aftermath of
          the Communist-led September Uprising. Which eventually became the
          cause for his vicious murder. </p>
          <h4> Life </h4>
          <p>
          Geo Milev was born Georgi Milev Kasabov in Radne mahale, today
          Radnevo, the first son in the family of school teachers Milyo and
          Anastasia Kasabovi. In 1897 the family moved to Stara Zagora, where
          his father started a publishing business in 1907. Geo Milev attended
          the town's high school from 1907 to 1911 before he went on to study
          at the Faculty of Philology of Sofia University. From 1912 Geo Milev
          continued his education at the Faculty of Philosophy of Leipzig
          University, where he was introduced to German Expressionism. On 30
          July 1914, two days after the outbreak of the First World War, he
          traveled from Leipzig to London, where he spent several months
          sightseeing and improving his English and met the Belgian Symbolist
          poet Émile Verhaeren. On returning to Germany, Geo Milev was
          detained in Hamburg on 18 October 1914 on suspicion of being an
          English spy. He was released after eleven days and returned to
          Leipzig, where he worked on his university thesis on Richard Dehmel.
          On 8 August 1915 he returned to Bulgaria without having obtained a
          degree. Beginning in 1916 he fought in World War I, where he was
          severely injured and lost his right eye.
           After recuperating in Berlin he began to collaborate with the
           magazine Aktion. Upon his return to Bulgaria he started to publish
          the Bulgarian modernist magazine Везни (Scales), in Sofia. He
          contributed to the publication as a translator, theatre reviewer,
          director and editor of anthologies.

          <h4> Death </h4>
          <p>
            On May 15, 1925, in the course of government reprisals following the
            St Nedelya Church assault, Geo Milev, a member of the Bulgarian
            Communist party, was taken to a police station for a
            "short interrogation" from which he never returned. His fate
            remained unknown for 30 years. In 1954 during the trial of General
            Ivan Valkov and a group of former police and military executioners,
            one of the defendants confessed how victims of the 1925 purge had
            been executed and where they were buried. Geo Milev had been
            strangled with wire and then buried in a mass grave in Ilientsi,
            near Sofia. His skull was found in the mass grave. His body was
            identified by the glass eye he was wearing after he lost his right
            eye in World War I.
